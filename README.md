# Introduction
The exercise text contents of this repository was collected from GitHub account of darkprinx, who himself had collected them from the GitHub account of zhiwehu. 
I collected it to practice and solve all the listed problems with python. Even after these collected problems are all set up, I will try to add more problems in near future. 
For every problem, I have added my solution at the top, followed by some other unique and good solutions which I found in the above said repository.
If you are a beginner with python then I hope these exercises will help you to get your hands free with python, just the way it did to me :)
Thank You, and have fun!
