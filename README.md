# Introduction
The exercise text contents of this repository was collected from GitHub account of [@darkprinx](https://github.com/darkprinx/100-plus-Python-programming-exercises-extended), who himself had collected them from the GitHub account of [@zhiwehu](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises).

I collected it to practice and solve all the listed problems with python. Even after these collected problems are all set up, I will try to add more problems in near future. 
For every problem, I have added my solution at the top, followed by some other unique and good solutions which I found in the above said repository.

I have divided the 100 exercises into 20 days, with each day carrying 5 excercises.

If you are a beginner with python then I hope these exercises will help you immensely, just the way they did to me :)

Thank You, and have fun!
